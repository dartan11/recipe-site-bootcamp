    <h1>Ingredients</h1>
    <p>
      - Tablespoon extra virgin olive oil or unsalted butter<br />
      - 1/2 pound pancetta or thick cut bacon<br />
      - Diced 1 to 2 garlic cloves, minced, about 1 teaspoon (optional)<br />
      - 3 to 4 whole eggs 1 cup grated Parmesan or pecorino cheese<br />
      - 1 pound spaghetti (or bucatini or fettuccine) Kosher salt and freshly -
      Ground black pepper to taste<br />
    </p>

    <h1>Instructions</h1>

    <ol>
      <li>
        Heat the pasta water: Put a large pot of salted water on to boil (1
        tablespoon salt for every 2 quarts of water.)
      </li>

      <li>
        Sauté the pancetta or bacon and garlic: While the water is coming to a
        boil, heat the olive oil or butter in a large sauté pan over medium
        heat. Add the bacon or pancetta and cook slowly until crispy. Add the
        garlic (if using) and cook another minute, then turn off the heat and
        put the pancetta and garlic into a large bowl.
      </li>
      <li>
        Beat the eggs and half of the cheese: In a small bowl, beat the eggs and
        mix in about half of the cheese.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cook the pasta: Once the water has reached a rolling boil, add the dry
        pasta, and cook, uncovered, at a rolling boil.
      </li>
      <li>
        Toss the pasta with pancetta or bacon: When the pasta is al dente (still
        a little firm, not mushy), use tongs to move it to the bowl with the
        bacon and garlic. Let it be dripping wet. Reserve some of the pasta
        water. Move the pasta from the pot to the bowl quickly, as you want the
        pasta to be hot. It's the heat of the pasta that will heat the eggs
        sufficiently to create a creamy sauce. Toss everything to combine,
        allowing the pasta to cool just enough so that it doesn't make the eggs
        curdle when you mix them in. (That's the tricky part.)
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the beaten egg mixture: Add the beaten eggs with cheese and toss
        quickly to combine once more. Add salt to taste. Add some pasta water
        back to the pasta to keep it from drying out. Serve at once with the
        rest of the parmesan and freshly ground black pepper. If you want,
        sprinkle with a little fresh chopped parsley.
